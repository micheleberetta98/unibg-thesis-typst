# UniBG Typst Thesis Template

A simple (unofficial) Typst template following the official
[UniBG formatting rules](https://www.unibg.it/studiare/frequentare/laurearsi/frontespizi).

*Also, checkout the [LaTeX version](https://github.com/micheleberetta98/unibg-thesis-template)!*

## :warning: Important note

This template is completely free of use.
However, as highlighted in the MIT license, you have to give credit in your thesis
acknowledgements:
- To the *UniBG Seclab* if you're doing your thesis with them
- Or to me, *Michele Beretta*, in every other case

Remember to also include a link to this repository for reference.
An example sentence you can use is the following:

> I would like to thank *[INSERT NAME]* for providing the Typst template [1] used
> during the writing of this thesis.
>
> [1] *Link to this repo*

You can use the "Cite this repository" button on the right.

## Requirements

- *Typst* [required] unsurprisingly

## Setup

1. Install Typst
2. Setup your work environment as you see fit. For example, you can either:
   - Use the "Use this template" button in GitHub and clone the new repo
   - Fork this repo
   - Just download the files
3. Start writing in Typst
4. Use `typst compile` to build the PDF manually, or `typst watch` to have a live
   preview

## Quick start

This is all you need, it should be self explanatory.

#import "unibg.typ": *
